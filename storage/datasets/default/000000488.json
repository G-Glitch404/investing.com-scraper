  "paragraph": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. is not looking for a war with the Houthis, the White House said on Tuesday. \n\"We're not looking to expand this. The Houthis have a choice to make and they still have time to make the right choice, which is to stop these reckless attacks,\" White House spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said. Attacks by the Houthis on ships in the Red Sea have affected companies and alarmed major world powers. The Houthis say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians."
