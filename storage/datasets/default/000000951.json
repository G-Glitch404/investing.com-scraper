        "US will not be blackmailed into anything. Turkey have brought this situation upon themselves by playing politics on swedens NATO membership and threatning their NATO alliance partners to block swedish membership. Turkey must show that they are truely interested in NATO security and unconditionally accept sweden as a member like all the other NATO allies have done. Then US will off course consider any requests from an NATO ally.",

REU\nANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told his U.S. counterpart Antony Blinken in a call on Wednesday that Turkey expected the United States to act in line with their NATO alliance and keep its promises on the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Ankara, a Turkish diplomatic source said. \nThe call came at the request of the U.S. side, a day after a Turkish parliamentary commission voted to approve Sweden's NATO membership bid, the source added. The parliament's general assembly must also approve the bid for it to be ratified. \"Fidan stated that, regarding the sale of F-16s, we expect the U.S. administration and U.S. Congress to act in line with the spirit of alliance and keep the promises made,\" the source said."
