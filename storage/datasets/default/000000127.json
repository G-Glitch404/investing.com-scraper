  "paragraph": "(Reuters) - Federal and local investigators on Thursday were working to determine what caused an airport hangar under construction to collapse in Boise, Idaho, killing three people and injuring nine others. The incident occurred at about 5 p.m. local time on Wednesday at the Boise Airport, the main airfield in the state's capital city, Boise Fire Department Division Chief of Operations Aaron Hummel said during a press conference.  \"There was a large-scale collapse of the building, the framework of the building,\" Hummel said. \"It was a pretty global collapse that occurred and the main structural members came down. It was fairly catastrophic.\" Three people died at the scene. Nine other people were injured, including five who were in critical condition at local hospitals, the city said in a statement on its website.  Local authorities and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials were investigating the cause the collapse, Hummel said.  A crane at the construction site also fell during the incident, Hummel said.  The Jackson Jet Center, which owns the building, said in a statement to local media that dozens of people were working on the construction site for its new 39,000-square-foot (3,623-square-meter) steel hangar.  Airport operations were not impacted by the incident, the Boise Fire Department said in a post on X."
