The rains flooded streets, the capital city's metro line and peoples' homes, bringing down trees and causing landslides.  \nRio's Mayor Eduardo Paes announced a state of emergency while President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government offered federal support. Firefighters are still looking for one woman who is missing after her vehicle fell in a river."
