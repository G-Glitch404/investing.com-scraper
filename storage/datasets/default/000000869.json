REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n2/5\nBy Andrew Kelly NEW YORK (Reuters) - After standing in New York City's Times Square for more than a dozen hours, thousands of revelers cheered in the New Year on Sunday night with the annual ceremony of a descending crystal-clad ball. Many had arrived early in the morning for a spot in one of the barricaded pens set up by the New York Police Department, ahead of musical performances by Megan Thee Stallion and LL Cool J before the final countdown to midnight. \"This is my first time to celebrate the New Year in Times Square,\" said Nadja Sjostrom, 44, who had traveled from Stockholm, Sweden, a few days earlier for the occasion and had been standing amid the giant illuminated billboards of Times Square since about 8 a.m.. It was a shorter commute for Markus Washington, a 49-year-old resident of Brooklyn, but also his first time at the Times Square celebration. \"It's a very good feeling,\" he said. \"Awesome. Cold, but awesome.\" \nAntonio Ruz, 51, had booked a flight from Granada, Spain, in order to make a lifelong dream come true, joining the crowds to get into the barricaded area at about 8.15 a.m.. \"Since I was a kid, I saw on TV this is spectacular show, so I had to live it,\" he said. He called it a \"once in a lifetime\" moment, emphasizing that he did not plan to return. \"I love New York, but 15 hours is too long to wait for a moment.\""
