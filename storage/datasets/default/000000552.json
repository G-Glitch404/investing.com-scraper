  "paragraph": "WASHINGTON - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has heightened its oversight of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s production practices following an incident with an Alaska Airlines 737-9 Max jet, where a door plug detached during flight. This move marks a shift from the prior self-regulated approach that Boeing had been allowed to maintain.\nThe recent emergency has not only spurred increased regulatory scrutiny but has also led to a class action lawsuit filed by passengers. Concerns have been amplified in light of Boeing's history, particularly after two fatal 737 Max crashes in the past few years that resulted in 346 deaths. These events have brought Boeing's commitment to safety standards into question.\nBoeing CEO Dave Calhoun publicly recognized the company's production challenges. In response to the latest incident, Boeing has initiated inspections across its production line, uncovering further issues, including loose bolts.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is actively investigating the circumstances that led to the emergency landing of the Alaska Airlines flight. Meanwhile, there are growing calls for the appointment of an independent industry monitor to oversee Boeing's adherence to stringent safety protocols, ensuring such incidents do not recur.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
